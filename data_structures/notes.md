Algorithm are set of sets to perform task efficiently. 
Data structure is a way to store data efficiently.
2 types of data structures
- premitive : int, float, string, boolean
- non-primitive
  - Linear: List, Tuples, linked list, array, queue, stack
  - Non-linear: Dictionary, Sets, Graph, Tree, 
Big -O notation is used describes the time eficiency of algorithms. It checks time and space complexity.
OMega greek notation is used for best case of algorithm
Theta greek notation is ued of avg case of algorithm
and Big O notation is used of worst case of algorithm

Run time complexity is measured by the number of opreation algorithm performs and illustrated as O(n) where n is operations.
O(nxn) Nsquare 

Rules of measuringtime complexity of code
1. simple statement , if codition Big0(1)
2. simple for loop bigO9n)
3. nested for loop big(n^2)
4. divide and conqure O(Logn)
5. when dealing wiht multiple statement just add them and remove constant and take biigest one.
