# Modeling Relationship

Relationships are **Verbs** in your use cases, example:
- What ingredients are **used** in a recipe?
- Who is **married** to this person?

## Naming relationships
In our example use cases, we could define these relationship types:
- USES
- MARRIED

Here, we have entities (Person, Residence) represented not as a single node, but as a network or linked nodes.
This is an extreme example of fanout, and is almost certainly **overkill** for any real-life solution, but some amount of fanout can be beneficial.

The main risk about fanout is that it can lead to very dense nodes, or supernodes. These are nodes that have hundreds of thousands of incoming or outgoing relationships **Supernodes** need to be handled carefully.

## Properties for relationships

Properties for a relationship are used to enrich how two nodes are related. When you define a property for a relationship, it is because your use cases ask a specific question about how two nodes are related, not just that they are related.
EX. we have a date property on the MARRIED relationship to further describe the relationship

## Creating Initial Relationships

Create relationships as per below instance model:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d734428d-0dd7-4972-a77b-17bb8a6c13cc)
```
//Search and set nodes to variables
MATCH (apollo:Movie {title: 'Apollo 13'})
MATCH (tom:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
MATCH (meg:Person {name: 'Meg Ryan'})
MATCH (danny:Person {name: 'Danny DeVito'})
MATCH (sleep:Movie {title: 'Sleepless in Seattle'})
MATCH (hoffa:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})
MATCH (jack:Person {name: 'Jack Nicholson'})

// create the relationships between nodes
MERGE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Jim Lovell'}]->(apollo)
MERGE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Sam Baldwin'}]->(sleep)
MERGE (meg)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Annie Reed'}]->(sleep)
MERGE (danny)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Bobby Ciaro'}]->(hoffa)
MERGE (danny)-[:DIRECTED]->(hoffa)
MERGE (jack)-[:ACTED_IN {role: 'Jimmy Hoffa'}]->(hoffa)

// Verify the created relationships
MATCH (p:Person)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p, a, m
```
## Identifying a New Relationship

We need to refactor the model for a new use case:
Use case #9: What users gave a movie a rating of 5?

We want to add some relationships between User nodes and Movie nodes so we can test our model.
```
//Find User 
MATCH (sandy:User {name: 'Sandy Jones'})
MATCH (clinton:User {name: 'Clinton Spencer'})
MATCH (apollo:Movie {title: 'Apollo 13'})
MATCH (sleep:Movie {title: 'Sleepless in Seattle'})
MATCH (hoffa:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})
//Set relationship and attributes
MERGE (sandy)-[:RATED {rating:5}]->(apollo)
MERGE (sandy)-[:RATED {rating:4}]->(sleep)
MERGE (clinton)-[:RATED {rating:3}]->(apollo)
MERGE (clinton)-[:RATED {rating:3}]->(sleep)
MERGE (clinton)-[:RATED {rating:3}]->(hoffa)
```
