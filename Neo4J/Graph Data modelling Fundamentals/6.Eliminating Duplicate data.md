# Eliminating Duplicate Data
De-duplicating data gives you the added benefit of allowing you to query through a node - for example, finding other customers who have purchased
a particular product, or finding similar movies based on the rating of other users.
## New use case
Use case #11: What movies are available in a particular language?

## Duplicate data example
Suppose we add a property to each Movie node in the graph named languages that represents the languages in which a movie is available.

Here we see that all Movie nodes have English in the list of languages. This is duplicate data and for a scaled database, would represent a lot of duplication.

## Adding Language Data
First add duplicate data to movie node property 
```
MATCH (apollo:Movie {title: 'Apollo 13'})
MATCH (sleep:Movie {title: 'Sleepless in Seattle'})
MATCH (hoffa:Movie {title: 'Hoffa'})
MATCH (casino:Movie {title: 'Casino'})
SET apollo.languages = ['English']
SET sleep.languages =  ['English']
SET hoffa.languages =  ['English', 'Italian', 'Latin']
SET casino.languages =  ['English']

```

Test the use case: Use case #11: What movies are available in a particular language?
```
MATCH (m:Movie)
WHERE 'Italian' IN m.languages
RETURN m.title
```

## Refactoring Duplicate Data
Below is currrent instance data model

There are two issues with the data model, especially if the graph scales:
- The name of the language is duplicated in many Movie nodes.
- In order to perform the query, all Movie nodes must be retrieved.
A solution here is to model properties as nodes.

### Refactor properties as nodes
Steps to refactor
- Take the property values for each Movie node and create a Language node.
- Create the IN_LANGUAGE relationship between that Movie node and the Language node.
- Finally, remove the languages property from the Movie node.

```
//Find all movie node
MATCH (m:Movie)

//UNWIND clause to separate each element of the languages property list into a separate row value
UNWIND m.languages AS language

// Creates node with label Language and assigns property name and its value from unwind row values
MERGE (l:Language {name:language})

// Create a relationship as IN_LANGUAGE between movie and language node
MERGE (m)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]->(l)

// Remove language property from movie
SET m.languages = null
```

After refactor we can test our use case 

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]-(l:Language)
WHERE  l.name = 'Italian'
RETURN m.title
```
## Adding Genre nodes from property
- query to add genre node
```
MATCH (m:Movie)
UNWIND m.genres as genres

MERGE (g:Genre {name:generes})
MERGE (m)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g)

SET m.genres = null
```
- query to test the refactor
```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN m.title, g.name
```
Rewrite the earlier query to accommodate genre changes
```
--Old query
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
  AND 'Drama' IN m.genres
RETURN m.title AS Movie

--New Query
MATCH (p:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks'
    AND g.name = 'Drama'
RETURN m.title AS Movie
