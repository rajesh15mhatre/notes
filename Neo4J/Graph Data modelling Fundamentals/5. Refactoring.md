# Refactoring

## Why refactor?
There are three reasons why you would refactor:
- The graph as modeled does not answer all of the use cases.
- A new use case has come up that you must account for in your data model.
- The Cypher for the use cases does not perform optimally, especially when the graph scales

## Steps for refactoring
To refactor a graph data model and a graph, you must:
- Design the new data model.
- Write Cypher code to transform the existing graph to implement the new data model.
- Retest all use cases, possibly with updated Cypher code.

# Labels at runtime
Node labels serve as an anchor point for a query.
For example:
- `MATCH (n) RETURN n` returns all nodes in the graph.
- `MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n` returns all Person nodes in the graph.

IMP: Your goal in modeling should be to reduce the size of the graph that is touched by a query.

Wrong approach: WE can use a label as Person as well as US (which is a country) in a node
Right approach: We can use a label as Person and a property as country: US in a node
_Note: But if you have a strong use case for having multiple labels for a node, you should do so._

- Do not overuse labels
Labels should be used if it will help with **most** of your use cases.A best practice is to limit the number of labels for a node to **4**.

- New use case for using additional label
Use case #10: What actors were born before 1950?

To satisfy the above use case, we will use the query below. The query is scanning all the person nodes, and if we have millions 
of person nodes, then this will not be an efficient query. Thus, we can add a lable called Actors to Person nodes 
then 
```
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
```

- Profiling a query
You can use the **PROFILE** keyword to see the performance for a query.
```
PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()
WHERE p.born < '1950'
RETURN p.name
```  
Because the cache is automatically populated, it is sometimes hard to measure performance with a small dataset. That is, db hits and elapsed time may not be comparable. What you can see, however, is the number of rows that are retrieved in the query and this number can be compared.

# Refactoring the model
Use "User' label to nodes 
Find all Person nodes that have an ACTED_IN relationship. We then set a label for the node.
```
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE exists ((p)-[:ACTED_IN]-())
SET p:Actor
```
Use "Director' label to nodes
```
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE EXISTS ((p)-[:DIRECTED]-())
SET p:Director
```

  - Test all the use cases

## Avoid These Labels
### Semantically orthogonal labels
“Semantically orthogonal” is a fancy term that means that labels should have nothing to do with one another. You should be careful not to use the same type of label in different contexts.
For example, using the region for all types of nodes is not useful for most queries.

### Representing class hierarchies
You also want to avoid labeling your nodes to represent hierarchies.

You should not do this where nodes have multiple labels that represent a hierarchy such as this:

This is often called “inheritance” or “IS-A” relationships. 
Instead, you should do this:
