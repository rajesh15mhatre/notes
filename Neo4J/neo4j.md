URL: https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/?category=beginners

Neo4j is graph DB which consists of Node and vertices. Node has 1 or more labels as text and properties as key-value pairs.
Vertices have one or two-way relationships.
So finally, a graph DB consists of nodes, labels, properties, vertices, and relationships.

- Node: means noun company, person or object like: facebook
- Label: node facebook may have the label as "company"
- Properties:  node facebook can have a property in key-value format ex,  "website: www.facebook.com"
- Relationship: Node can have a Bi-directional relationship ex: Jhon --"works at"--> facebook and facebook --"employs"--> Jhon


## 2. Thinking in Graphs:
Different DB use case:
- Document DB is used for flexibility
- Column DB is used for scalability
- Key-value store for simiplicity and high performance
