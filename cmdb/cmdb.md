## CMDB Architecture:
- Input:
  - Discovery: automated discovery of network devices
  - Service Mapping: Get the details of CIs
  - API: updating tables using APIs
- Identification and reconciliation Engine: validate input data to maintain accuracy and identity of data and avoid duplicate data.
- Data is ready to consume
  
## Challenges in CMDB:
-	Customization: How to classify CIs
-	Representation: Architectural design 
-	Ownership: Lack of stakeholder and CI ownership results in CI in silos.
-	Principles: Lack of guidelines
-	Informal CMDB: old or legacy and improper data
-	Communication: CMDB visibility, Awareness and lack of ownership
