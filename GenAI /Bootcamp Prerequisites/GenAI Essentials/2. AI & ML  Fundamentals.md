# AI and ML Fundamentals
## 1. What is AI
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Machines that perform tasks that **mimic human behavior**.
- Machine Learning (ML): Machines that improve at a task **without explicit programming**.
- Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses **artificial neural networks**, inspired by the **human brain**, to solve complex problems.
- Generative AI (GenAI): A specialized subset of AI that **generates content** such as:

### What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
A subset of AI focused on creating new content or data that is novel and realistic.
Unlike traditional AI, GenAI can generate new data itself.


Examples:
Generating text, images, music, speech, and other forms of media.

### Key Technologies:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Transformer models (e.g., GPT)

GenAI Modalities(sensens like human touch, listen & so on):
- Vision: Creating realistic images/videos
- Text: Generating human-like text
- Audio: Composing music
- Molecular: Drug discovery using genomic data

### Important Term:

Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Üí A subset of GenAI that specializes in generating human-like text.
Often confused with general AI due to its popularity

### Comparison: AI vs Generative AI

| Category | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Generative AI (GenAI)|
|-----:|---------------|---------------|
|     Functionality|Focuses on understanding and decision-making |Focuses on creating new, original content|
|     Data Handling|Uses existing data for analysis and decision-making	|Uses existing data to generate new unseen outputs|
|     Applications| Used across multiple industries for automation, NLP, data analysis, and healthcare|Focuses on creative content generation, deepfakes, and synthetic data|


## 3. What is Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application for creating documents that combine:
- Live code
- Narrative text
- Equations
- Visualizations

Originally developed as part of IPython, Jupyter Notebooks evolved into a standalone tool.

### What is JupyterLab?
JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Jupyter.
It includes:
- Notebook
- Terminal
- Text Editor
- File Browser
- Rich Outputs

‚úÖ Combines flexibility and power in one interface.
üîÑ JupyterLab will eventually replace Jupyter Notebook.

### What is JupyterHub?
JupyterHub is a server-based platform that runs JupyterLab for multiple users.
Ideal for:
- üë©‚Äçüè´ A class of students
- üè¢ Corporate data science teams
- üî¨ Scientific research groups

It manages authentication, spawns individual notebook instances, and controls access.

## 4.Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Definition:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a Machine Learning technique that enables computers to understand the context of a corpus (a body of related text).
- Key Functions of NLP
  - Analyze and interpret text (e.g., emails, documents).
  - Interpret spoken language (e.g., sentiment analysis).
  - Synthesize speech (e.g., voice assistants).
  - Translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
  - Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.
### Core Components of NLP
- Text Wrangling and Pre-Processing
  - Conversion ‚Äì Transform text into a standardized format.
  - Sanitization ‚Äì Remove noise, unnecessary characters.
  - Tokenization ‚Äì Split text into words or phrases.
  - Stemming ‚Äì Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").
  - Lemmatization ‚Äì Normalize words based on their dictionary meaning.
- Language Understanding (Structure/Syntax)
  - Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging ‚Äì Identify nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
  - Chunking ‚Äì Group related words together.
  - Dependency Parsing ‚Äì Analyze grammatical relationships in a sentence.
  - Constituency Parsing ‚Äì Break down a sentence into hierarchical sub-units.
- Processing and Functionality
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) ‚Äì Identify proper names (e.g., people, places).
  - N-gram Identification ‚Äì Analyze word sequences to predict text.
  - Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì Detect emotions and opinions in text.
  - Information Extraction ‚Äì Identify key information from unstructured data.
  - Information Retrieval ‚Äì Find relevant documents or data.
  - Questions and Answering ‚Äì Process user queries for precise answers.
  - Topic Modeling ‚Äì Identify key themes in text data.

## 5. Regression Study Notes
- What is Regression?
Regression is the process of finding a function to correlate a labeled dataset into a continuous variable/number.
Outcome: Predict a variable in the future, e.g., "What will the temperature be next week?" (20¬∞C).
- Key Concepts
  - Vectors (dots): Represent data points plotted on a graph (e.g., X, Y dimensions).
  - Regression Line: A line drawn through the dataset to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.
  - Error: The distance of the vector (data point) from the regression line.
- Types of Errors Used in Regression
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE):
    - Calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
    - Purpose: Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
    - Use Case: Suitable when large errors are highly critical.
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - Square root of MSE, returning error to the same units as the target variable (e.g., ¬∞C).
    - Purpose: Easier to interpret due to matching units.
    - Use Case: Commonly used for evaluating model performance.
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
    - Purpose: Treats all errors equally without amplifying larger deviations.
    - Use Case: Robust to outliers and provides a simple measure of deviation.
- Key Points to Remember
  - Lower Error Values = Better Model Performance.
  - Use MSE or RMSE when larger errors are more problematic.
  - Use MAE for a simpler, more balanced error measurement.
- Example Use Case
  - Predicting the temperature next week based on past weather data using regression analysis.

## 6.Classification
- Definition
Classification is a process of finding a function to divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories.
- Example
Predicting a category based on input data.
- Example Question: Will it rain next Saturday?
Possible categories: Sunny, Rainy.
- Key Concept
  - A classification line separates the dataset into different classes.
  - Data on one side belongs to Sunny.
  - Data on the other side belongs to Rainy.
- Classification Algorithms
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree / Random Forest
  - Neural Networks
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
