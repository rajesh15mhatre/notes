# AI and ML Fundamentals
## 1. What is AI
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Machines that perform tasks that **mimic human behavior**.
- Machine Learning (ML): Machines that improve at a task **without explicit programming**.
- Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses **artificial neural networks**, inspired by the **human brain**, to solve complex problems.
- Generative AI (GenAI): A specialized subset of AI that **generates content** such as:
Image, Video, Text, Audio.

## 2. AI vs Generative AI
### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI refers to computer systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as:
- Problem-solving
- Decision-making
- Understanding natural language
- Recognizing speech and images

### AI‚Äôs goal:
To interpret, analyze, and respond to human actions, simulating human intelligence in machines.

- Key Concepts:
  - Simulate: Mimics aspects and behavior.
  - Emulate: Replicates exact processes and mechanisms.

### AI Applications:
- Expert systems
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Speech recognition
- Robotics

### Industry Use Cases:
- Customer service: B2C chatbots
- E-commerce: Recommendation systems
- Automotive: Autonomous vehicles
- Medical: Diagnosis and treatment support

### What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
A subset of AI focused on creating new content or data that is novel and realistic.
Unlike traditional AI, GenAI can generate new data itself.


Examples:
Generating text, images, music, speech, and other forms of media.

### Key Technologies:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Transformer models (e.g., GPT)

GenAI Modalities(sensens like human touch, listen & so on):
- Vision: Creating realistic images/videos
- Text: Generating human-like text
- Audio: Composing music
- Molecular: Drug discovery using genomic data

### Important Term:

Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Üí A subset of GenAI that specializes in generating human-like text.
Often confused with general AI due to its popularity

### Comparison: AI vs Generative AI

| Category | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Generative AI (GenAI)|
|-----:|---------------|---------------|
|     Functionality|Focuses on understanding and decision-making |Focuses on creating new, original content|
|     Data Handling|Uses existing data for analysis and decision-making	|Uses existing data to generate new unseen outputs|
|     Applications| Used across multiple industries for automation, NLP, data analysis, and healthcare|Focuses on creative content generation, deepfakes, and synthetic data|


## 3. What is Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application for creating documents that combine:
- Live code
- Narrative text
- Equations
- Visualizations

Originally developed as part of IPython, Jupyter Notebooks evolved into a standalone tool.

### What is JupyterLab?
JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Jupyter.
It includes:
- Notebook
- Terminal
- Text Editor
- File Browser
- Rich Outputs

‚úÖ Combines flexibility and power in one interface.
üîÑ JupyterLab will eventually replace Jupyter Notebook.

### What is JupyterHub?
JupyterHub is a server-based platform that runs JupyterLab for multiple users.
Ideal for:
- üë©‚Äçüè´ A class of students
- üè¢ Corporate data science teams
- üî¨ Scientific research groups

It manages authentication, spawns individual notebook instances, and controls access.
