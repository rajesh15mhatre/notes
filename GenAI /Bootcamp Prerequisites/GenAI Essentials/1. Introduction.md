[GenAI Roadmap on Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/956919b6-2736-4b0a-897b-fe80884b4698/edit)
- Fundamentals of Machine Learning & Generative AI
  - Machine Learning Basics
Important to understand vectors, embeddings, and transformer architectures.
Not necessary to be a mathematician, but basic understanding helps.
- Generative AI Basics

  - Includes text, image, video, 3D, and audio generation.
  - Advanced fields include protein and DNA folding for health sciences.
  - Understanding modality is crucial (input vs. output types).

Core Components of Generative AI
Agentic Workflows & Agentic Coding

Advanced topics but important for understanding autonomous AI agents.
Responsible AI

Ethics, Bias, and AI governance are essential for safe AI use.
LLM Fundamentals

Tokenization, context windows, prompting techniques.
Importance of understanding LLM limitations and capabilities.
AI Tools & Applications
AI-Powered Assistants

Popular tools: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral.
Limited programmatic functionality, best for general use.
Workbenches & Playgrounds

Used for experimentation with different models.
Examples: Cohere, OpenAI Playground, Anthropic Claude.
Model Selection

Foundational models, fine-tuned models, instruction models, open-source models.
Edge-optimized models: Smaller models running on local devices.
Uncensored models: Provide unrestricted responses but pose risks.
Model as a Service (MaaS)

Google, AWS, Azure, Alibaba provide hosted LLMs.
Grok & Groq focus on open-source model serving.
Development & Implementation
Dev Tools & Workflows

Hugging Face: The GitHub of AI, central for model sharing.
LangChain, LlamaIndex: Orchestration tools for LLMs & agents.
Bedrock & SageMaker: AWS solutions for deploying AI workloads.
AI Code Assistance & App Prototyping

GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Codium, Cursor.
Streamlit, Gradio: Rapid app prototyping.
Developer Environment Setup

Conda, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks are key tools.
Many free resources exist for learning AI cost-effectively.
AI Security & Model Deployment
Security in Generative AI
